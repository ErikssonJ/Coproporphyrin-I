Below you find the goodness-of-fit visual diagnostic plot (observed versus simulated plasma concentration) for the PBPK model performance of all data used presented in [Section 2.2.2](#222-clinical-data). Note that the model represents one mean state with constant endogenous concentrations, and this explains the horizontal spread of the residuals in the plot.
