The PBPK model for Coproporphyrin-I was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* baseline endogenous Coproporphyrin-I data.
* DDIs with OATP1B1 perpetrators rifampicin and probenecid (in OATP1B1/3-DDI qualification report).

The model quantifies syntethis of Coproporphyrin-I in the liver, excretion via urine through glomerular filtration, influx to liver via OATP1B1/1B3 and excretion to bile via MRP2.

Of note, the suggested workflow when assessing DDIs using Coproporphyrin-I is to re-estimate the baseline Coproporphyrin-I for the specific study as the baseline will vary across studies. 

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-pitavastatin-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-pitavastatin-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles), model verification plots will be available in the OATP1B1/3-DDI qualification report.
